In this project you will design a compiler in your preferred programming language. The compiler will
convert simple C programs with the following properties:

- Has only one main() function.
- At least one array initialization is supported. Initialized arrays are stored inside stack.
- cout or print will be implemented by syscall.
- Only while loops will be supported.
- Only integer variables are supported.
- All conditions and if-else will be supported.
- Add, subtract, and, or, nand, nor, xor, xnor will be supported.
- You can make further reasonable assumptions.

The resultant code will be able to be executed on MARS to get credit.

**BONUS:**
1. Additional function implementation (20pts).
2. For loop implementation (10pts).
3. char type implementation (10pts).
4. Divide, Multiply implementation (10pts).
